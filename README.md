## 👋🏽 Hello, 

My name is Vasanth, and I make web apps.

I have an immense love for minimalistic designs and web technologies.
I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, Vue.js & Node.js.

I worked on multiple side projects from time to time. Find some of the active ones below as pinned projects. Most of these side projects are started mainly to scratch my own itch. If you like any one of them, please send me a note, it helps me move forward.
