## Hi there üëãüèΩ

My name is Vasanth, and I make web apps. I enjoy working where design meets code. I have an immense love for minimalistic designs and web technologies.

I have worked on multiple side projects from time to time, some of them got featured as top products in Hacker New  Product Hunt. Find some of some of my works pinned below. All my side projects will be free to use for everyone. 

I am currently active with building [Currl](https://currl.io). **Currl** is a free text-based social bookmarking website. You can collect the links you love from around the web, you can also store them privately or share them publicly with your followers.

It is 100% free to use for everyone. We do not show you ads or sponsored content. We do not collect or sell your data to third parties. We are independent and would like to stay that way, so no VCs. 

If you like my projects, consider supporting me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/vasanthv).
